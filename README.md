# CovaPT
Analytic covariance of the galaxy power spectrum multipoles based on [arXiv:1910.02914](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02914)


The modules currently uploaded are
1) Covariance for a periodic box in real space (Periodic_Box.ipynb)
2) Gaussian covariance for an arbitrary survey window (Survey_window_kernels.ipynb)

We are currently working on getting the other modules ready. Thanks for the interest and apologies for the delay. If you are interested in a particular part of the calculation, please feel free to email me at: jay.wadekar@nyu.edu
